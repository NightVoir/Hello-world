# Hello-world
This is my introduction to Github
<p>I have been writing sci-fi fantasy for twenty years. I play guitar and love to read, I'm new to voice over and want to make a podcast about comics, writing, fantasy and pop culture.</p>
<p>I enjoy travelling to different countries and experiencing different cultures. Last winter I visited Mongolia for the first time and experienced my first real winter.</p>
<p>I moved to Nashville, TN in May of this year so I could be independent and forge my own reality.</p>
